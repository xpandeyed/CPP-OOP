# CPP-OOP

Types of inheritance:
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multi-level
3. Multiple
4. Hierarchical
5. Hybrid

Modes of inheritance:
1. Private
2. Protected
3. Public

Virtual functions in cpp:
Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for function call.
They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism  
Virtual functions cannot be static.  
They can be friend function.  
To achieve runtime polymorphism they must be invoked using pointer or reference of base class type.  
Destructors can be virtual but constructors cannot be.  

### OOPS advantages and disadvantages
<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Advantages</strong></td><td><strong>Disadvantages</strong></td></tr><tr><td>We can reuse the code multiple times using class</td><td>Size is larger than other programs</td></tr><tr><td>Inherit the class to subclass for data redundancy</td><td>It required a lot of effort to create</td></tr><tr><td>It is easy to maintain and modify</td><td>It is slower than other programs</td></tr><tr><td>It maintains the security of data</td><td>It is not suitable for some sorts of problems</td></tr><tr><td>Low-cost development</td><td>It takes time to get used to it.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Types of binding:
1. Late Binding (Runtime binding) is done according to the content of pointer.
2. Early Binding (Comple time binding) is done according to type of pointer.

This repository contains Obeject Oriented Programming in C++, I saved to revise later.  
  
This repository has explanation comments for the understanding of the code.
