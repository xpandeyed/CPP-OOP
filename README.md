# CPP-OOP

Virtual functions in cpp:
Virtual functions cannot be static.
They can be friend function.
To achieve runtime polymorphism they must be invoked using pointer or reference of base class type.
Destructors can be virtual but constructors cannot be.

Types of binding:
1. Late Binding (Runtime binding) is done according to the content of pointer.
2. Early Binding (Comple time binding) is done according to type of pointer.

This repository has explanation comments for the understanding of the code.
